# Open Poems
Let's write some poetry together!

I'd really like to try out writing collaborative poems, using only GitHub as a tool for collaboration.

## WIP Contribution Guidelines
- To add, edit, or remove content from a poem, you must use a __pull request__! Read these two guides to find out how to do that: [How to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [How to pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
- To create a new poem, follow these steps:
  - Open a new issue with the title or idea of your poem.
  - Create a new __Label__ pertaining to your poem.
  - Assign yourself to the issue.
  - Fork this repo and create a new folder with a `README.md` file inside it.
  - Submit a pull request and a core maintainer can accept it.
  - To add content to your poem, keep submitting pull requests and referencing the issue you just made.
  

## General Rules & Suggestions
1. Be kind, be gentle, and be open.
2. Let the concept of authorship be replaced by the concept of collaboration. We can all be authors of the same poem.
3. Don't be afraid to critique poems, ask how to write a poem, or ask for feedback.
